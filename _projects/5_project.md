## Private childcare subsidies and vouchers

We study the introduction of early childhood education and care (ECEC) subsidies and vouchers in Finland. In the Nordic context, where universal childcare provision is common, we study two policy expansions between 1997 and 2017.

New working paper on **private day care allowance** is available (in Finnish) [here](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/353434)[^note]. Summary of main results in English:

* This study examines private day care allowance from 1997 to 2017. The research sample includes families with children aged 1–5 in private day care, public day care, and home care in Finland.

* Private day care allowance was introduced in 1997. With private day care allowance, families can purchase early childhood education services from private providers. The municipality can pay families additional municipal supplements in addition to the statutory private day care allowance. During the 2000s, the number of municipalities offering municipal supplements increased, partly accelerating the spread of private early childhood education services. Since 2009, however, municipalities have been able to offer families vouchers to purchase private early childhood education services.

* The importance of the means-tested care supplement aimed at low-income families has decreased, while the importance of municipal supplements has increased. In 1997–1998, 30 percent of the families receiving support received a care supplement; in 2000, 24 percent of families received a care supplement; from 2010 onwards, less than 1 out of 10 families received a care supplement. On the other hand, at the beginning of the 2000s, about 60 families receiving support for private care received the municipal supplement. In 2017, 88 percent of families received municipal supplements.

* Based on the results, most families that use private day care allowance have a high income. However, the socioeconomic differences in the use of private care have remained the same in the past 20 years.

* Results also show that families buy more expensive private early childhood education services in the late 2010s than in the early 2000s. In 2007, the average price of private day care was 642 euros per month (in 2017 prices). The average price was 860 euros per month per child in 2017. A few factors can explain the increase in average prices:

1. High-income families buy more expensive services than low-income families.
2. Children enter early education earlier in the 2010s and 2020s than at the beginning of the 21st century.
3. Private services are concentrated in urban areas, where wages and rents are higher than in the rest of the country.
