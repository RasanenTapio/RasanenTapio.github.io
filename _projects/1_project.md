EUROMOD is a harmonized microsimulation model covering all EU member states. The model provides a standardized, flexible solution for cross-country comparison of tax-benefit policies. Uses of the model include evidence-based ex-ante policy evaluation, such as estimating the effects of policy changes on income distribution. In addition, EUROMOD is essential for producing flash estimate indicators on income poverty and inequality in the European Commission.

European Commission Joint-Research Center and National teams from member states jointly update the model annually. The EUROMOD update project for Finland includes documenting Finland's up-to-date tax-transfer policy system and producing an input dataset for the most recent year available.
