Goal: EUROMOD is a harmonized microsimulation model covering all EU member states. The model provides a standardized, flexible solution for cross-country comparison of tax-benefit policies. Uses of the model include evidence based ex-ante policy evaluation, such as estimating effects of policy changes on income distribution. In addition, EUROMOD is an essential tool for producing flash estimate indicators on income poverty and inequality in the EC.

European Commission Joint-Research Center, University of Essex and National teams from member states jointly update the model annually. EUROMOD update project for Finland includes documenting the up-to-date tax-transfer policy system for Finland and producing an input dataset for the most recent year available.
