Hi, welcome to my homepage! I'm a senior researcher at the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, Kela, and a Ph.D. in economics from Jyväskylä University School of Business and Economics. I also work as a project research in [FLUX](https://fluxconsortium.fi/) (Family Formation in Flux – Causes, Consequences and Possible Futures) at Åbo Akademi University.

My research interests include family policies and their (sometimes unintended) effects. For example, how parental leaves and childcare subsidies affect families’ choices. I also study how childbirth affects earnings, the wage gap between women and men, and gender differences in the labor market.
